# Iris-Data-Project

This was one of my first attempts at a simple data science project, so I could get a better feel of the process of doing things. So far I've only done basic visualization and modeling techniques, but since it's just a small, simple dataset that's already clean and concise, I'm not sure what else there is to do.
